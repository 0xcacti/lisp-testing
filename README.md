# cl-testing

Simple testing framework for CL using macros.  
Designed to imitate jest. 


Okay, I actually really did it.  It's a very simple one file repo, 
but I can use it in the future, and moreover.  I really feel proud of this 
stupid one file repo.  

Macros are really cool and I'm starting to get the hang of them I think.
